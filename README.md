# Employee Attrition Prediction Using Machine Learning Models  

## Project Description  

This project aims to predict employee resignation probabilities based on various identified factors, helping organizations develop effective retention strategies. Employee turnover can be costly for companies, not only financially but also in terms of team morale and productivity. By leveraging machine learning models, we seek to provide organizations with valuable tools to improve employee retention.  

## Implemented Models  

Three machine learning models were implemented and compared for employee attrition prediction:  

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 86%.  
- **Random Forests**: Reached an accuracy of 83%, proving to be a robust alternative.  
- **Naive Bayes**: Although it had a lower accuracy of 76%, it remains useful under certain circumstances.  

## Data Preprocessing  

To ensure the quality and reliability of the results, an extensive data preprocessing process was carried out:  

- **Handling Missing Data**: Properly managed to avoid biases in the models.  
- **Data Standardization**: Numerical data was normalized to improve learning efficiency.  
- **Categorical Data Encoding**: Adjusted to be correctly interpreted by the models.  
- **Outlier Removal**: Identified and eliminated outliers that could distort the results.  

## Results  

"The study successfully identified the most effective models for predicting employee attrition, providing organizations with key insights to design retention strategies that minimize turnover and enhance productivity."  

## Comparison with Previous Studies  

A comparison was conducted with prior research on employee attrition, evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed models relative to other approaches. The obtained results support the validity of the techniques used and offer a significant improvement in prediction accuracy compared to other methods.
